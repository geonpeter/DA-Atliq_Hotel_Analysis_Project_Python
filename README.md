# Atliq Hotel Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing data from hotels owned by Atliq using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The analysis covers various aspects of the hotel operations, including data cleaning, transformation, and insightful exploration using the Pandas library.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide valuable insights into Atliq's hotel business by cleaning, transforming, and analyzing the data collected from its hotels. The analysis helps to understand trends, uncover hidden patterns, and provide meaningful reports to assist in better decision-making.

## Tools and Technologies

- Jupyter Notebook: The platform used for developing and executing the code.
- Python: The programming language used throughout the project.
- Pandas: The primary library used for data manipulation, cleaning, and transformation.
I really enjoy working with Python, especially for data-related tasks, and this project showcases the power and flexibility of Python for data analysis.

## Key Steps in the Analysis

### Data Cleaning:
- Handled missing values and corrected data inconsistencies.
- Standardized data formats for better analysis.
### Data Transformation:
- Performed several transformations to reshape the data for deeper analysis.
- Created new calculated fields to aid in understanding hotel performance metrics.
### Data Analysis:
- Generated summary statistics and visualizations to explore key metrics such as occupancy rates, revenue per available room (RevPAR), and other financial and operational data.
- Analyzed trends over time, seasonal fluctuations, and customer behavior.
- The detailed transformations and analysis steps are documented in the attached Jupyter Notebook.
